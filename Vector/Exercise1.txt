Practice using vectors.
(15 points total)
Write a complete c++ program that uses 2 vectors, 1 for names (strings) and 1 for grades (longs).
[2 points for declaring the vectors correctly]
a. Ask the user for the number of name/grade pairs that will be entered. [1 point]
b. Get each of the names and grades. [3 points]
c. Display the mean of the grades [3 points]
d. Display the median of the grades [3 points]
e. Display the mode of the grades. [2 points] Display the names of the students with the mode
as their grade. [1 point]
f. 3 points bonus: Make part e work even when the grades list is multi modal.
Use the sort algorithm built into the C++ STL to sort your list when needed.
